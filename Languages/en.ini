EnglishLocalized=Removes honorifics, changes most instances of Seele calling Bronya "onii-chan" to her calling Bronya by name, and removes Bronya's habit of referring to herself in third person. No other changes.
'
EnglishLiteral=Keeps honorifics (ex. Himeko-sensei, Mei-senpai) and uses a more direct translation, so Seele will continue to call Bronya "onii-chan" instead of by name. Bronya also talks in third person sometimes. Use this one if you prefer honorifics and/or you're worried about some meaning being lost in translation.
