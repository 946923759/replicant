--DictionaryDescriptions
Honkai	"Houkai" is a recurring natural disaster phenomenon that happens during regular self-adjustments of the universe. It may manifest in many different forms, ranging from plagues, diseases, and weather-related disasters to comets smashing into planets and obelisks turning up to annihilate all beings. Whenever a Houkai Outbreak occurs, the species currently at the top of the food chain would usually be hit devastatingly hard. The 14th-century Black Death plague and the dinosaur extinction in the Cretaceous Era, for example, were both very likely results Houkai Outbreaks.\n\nNote:"Honkai" is the English localized name of Houkai, which means "Collapse" in Japanese.
The First Honkai Outbreak	This is a grand-scale Houkai phenomenon caused by the accumulation of specific Houkai Energy types. Big Houkai Outbreaks affect a wider range than the average Houkai Outbreak, and bring about more serious destruction. Meanwhile, Houkai Beasts of a higher level than Zombies may also be spawned. What's more, with each Big Houkai Outbreak, a Herrscher will always be born.
'
The Second Houkai Outbreak	On December 25th, 2000, a large-scale Houkai Outbreak occurred in Pripyat, Siberia. That was when the second Herrscher, Sirin, was born. To combat the huge number of enemies that spawned during the large-scale Houkai Outbreak, the Shicksal deployed an enormous amount of armed forces, most of which were destroyed in their quest to defeat the Second Herrscher and suppress the Second Big Houkai Outbreak. Though the armed forces did succeed in their quest, the Pripyat area ended up a wasteland and was forever under quarantine.
The Third Houkai Outbreak	On March 28th, 2014, the Third Big Houkai Outbreak occurred with Senba Academy, Nagazora as its Source. The Third Herrscher, Raiden Mai, was thus born. The Third Big Houkai Outbreak destroyed Nagazora in its entirety, but the Third Herrscher wasn't able to successfully transform and was currently still at large.
'
Herrscher	Humans corrupted by Honkai Energy that gain incredible power and sometimes immortality. They are born in the center of a Honkai Outbreak and obey the Will of the Honkai, having an instinctive desire to destroy everything. Although not in this story, some of them can control their desires and even fight back against the Honkai.
