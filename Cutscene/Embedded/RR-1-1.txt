/Kiana	Hey. It's me, Kiana. 
extend	I am currently at Senba Academy in Nagazora, in the Far East. I know you must be going after this Honkai outbreak. Just know that I will find you, no matter where you go!
/	[i]Beep![/i]
/Kiana	(Huff...) I've talked enough. I didn't expect this outbreak to happen so suddenly. 
msg	According to my observations, it should be a small outbreak. Let's assume the range covers the entire Senba Academy grounds.
msg	Now I just have to find the target before 「Schicksal」 arrives-- this time, I'm not letting them get away!
/Zombies	Blaa---ah--- Whoo---oorgh---
/Kiana	Honkai infected zombies are already roaming... Good thing I made sure to prepare weapons in advance.

/Kiana	Weapon inspection done. It seems fine. I have my ammo and my gear here... Don't really know how long these old things will last.
msg	Well~ Regardless, let's stick to the plan and get out of this library first.

msg	I was expecting as much, but there's zombies on the escape route...
msg	Human beings, infected and mutated by the Honkai... with no more emotions, no more consciousness.\nLike walking corpses. Such sad creatures.
/Zombies	Blaa---ah--- Whoo---oorgh---
/Kiana	I'm sorry. Even still, I can't show you mercy.\nAs a final favour, I will help you sleep in peace.
